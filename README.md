# ShopLite Load Tests — Gatling (Scala DSL)

Performance test for the **ShopLite** e-commerce API, implemented with **Gatling** using the **Scala DSL**.
It mirrors the same user journey as the [JMeter version](https://github.com/scherednychenko/ShopLite-load-tests):
**Browse catalog → Add to cart (N items) → Checkout**, against placeholder endpoints
served by a tiny local mock backend.

This repo is part of a small series implementing the *same* scenario in different tools
(JMeter, k6, Locust, Gatling). A [Java DSL variant](https://github.com/scherednychenko/ShopLite-load-tests-gatling-javaDSL)
of this exact simulation exists for a Scala-vs-Java comparison.

## Contents
- `gatling/simulations/ShopLiteSimulation.scala` — the simulation: 3 transactions, feeders, SLO assertions
- `gatling/Dockerfile` — Gatling 3.10.5 bundle image (compiles the simulation at run time)
- `mock/` — dependency-free mock backend for the 3 placeholder endpoints
- `docker-compose.yml` — one-command demo (mock → Gatling → HTML report)
- `docs/Proposed_Test_Approach.md` — performance testing strategy (SLIs/SLOs, cadence, Agile fit)
- `docs/Project_Brief.md` — anonymized project brief / context

## Run everything in Docker (one command)
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
Gatling waits for the mock to be healthy, runs the simulation, and writes its rich HTML
report to `results/shoplitesimulation-<timestamp>/index.html`.

## The test
- **TX_Browse_Catalog** — `GET /api/catalog`
- **TX_Add_To_Cart** — `POST /api/cart/items` ×`CART_SIZE`, correlates `cartId` (JSONPath)
- **TX_Checkout_PlaceOrder** — `POST /api/orders` with unique guest data (feeder)

### SLOs (Gatling assertions — the run fails if breached)
| Assertion | Budget |
|---|---|
| `global.failedRequests.percent` | < 1% |
| `global.responseTime.percentile(95)` | < 500 ms |

### Tunable via env vars
`BASE_URL`, `VUS`, `CART_SIZE` (set in `docker-compose.yml`).

## Notes
- Endpoints are placeholders; the mock returns the minimal contract (`cartId`/`orderId`) so the journey runs green.
- The mock's latencies are illustrative only — this demonstrates the tooling and reporting, not real system performance.
- Gatling generates its standard interactive HTML report (per-request stats, percentiles, distribution charts).
